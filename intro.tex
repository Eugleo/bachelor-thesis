Proteins are amino acid biopolymers that take part in most natural processes in living organisms. Among other things, they are vital for cell growth, reproduction, metabolism, and movement~\cite{johnson1994sequential, prescott1968regulation, ketelaar2004actin, elston1998energy}. Proteins can also frequently serve as potential drug targets, because they play a crucial role in most diseases~\cite{konopatskaya2010protein, yamin2008amyloid}.

Protein function is highly dependent on its structure~\cite{orengo1999protein} which is at least partially determined by the sequence of the protein~\cite{anfinsen1973principles}. The structure is oftentimes stabilised by disulfide bonds~\cite{wedemeyer2000disulfide, mcauley2008contributions}, which can by extension directly or indirectly influence protein function~\cite{nagahara2011intermolecular}, and its regulation~\cite{chiu2019allosteric}. Thus the study of disulfide bond positions is a key part of protein structure and function research. Furthermore, the knowledge of the positions of fixed-length crosslinks --- such as disulfide bonds --- can be utilised to constrain protein folding methods based on molecular dynamic simulations, improving their accuracy and performace~\cite{brodie2017solving}.

A popular method of disulfide mapping is tandem mass spectrometry. In mass spectrometry experiments aiming to characterise disulfide bond connectivity, the studied protein is broken down to shorter peptides called precursors. The precursors are then fragmented to even shorter peptides called fragments. Depending on the specific choice of instrumentation and analysis method, either the precursors or the fragments are searched for peptides connected by a disulfide bond. The matches are used to identify the disulfide bonds that were present in the analysed protein.

There exist many computational methods that are able to automatically indentify simple crosslinked peptides in a peptide-bond-peptide arrangemet~\cite{lakbub2018recent, liu2014facilitating}. However, indentification of more complex disulfide bond configurations --- such as multiple interconnected peptides, or a single peptide with one or intrapeptide bonds --- has proved to be challenging. Researchers often have to resort to labour-intensive partial reduction methods~\cite{wu1997novel, li2013disulfide}.

In this thesis we first review the popular proteomic mass spectrometry methods, focusing on those that are relevant for disulfide bond characterisation. We also mention some challenges caused by the common sample preparation protocol.

In the second chapter, we propose a new method for automatic differential disulfide bond characterisation, implemented in our command-line program \emph{Dibby}. Dibby's aim is to provide a richer set of options for fragment search, leading to better disulfide bond identifications even in complex cases. To achieve this flexibility, Dibby extends the fragment search space to include every possible peptide fragment, independently of its disulfide bond configuration. The algorithms make use of the \emph{divide and conquer}~\cite{smith1985design} and \emph{branch and bound}~\cite{boyd2007branch} techniques to make the search more effective, even though the search space is very large. To keep the false discovery rate under control, we additionally perform simple differential analysis on reduced samples that do not contain any disulfide bonds.

Finally, we evaluate Dibby on measured and in-silico generated datasets, and show that thanks to the flexibility of its matching algorithm, Dibby is able to identify even the more complicated peptides with intrapeptide bonds.
