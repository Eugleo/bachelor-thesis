\def\Dedication{%
  Dedication. First and foremost, I thank my supervisor and former colleague RNDr. Miroslav Kratochvíl, Ph.D., for his guidance and assistance during my research and during the writing of this thesis.

  I thank doc. RNDr. Josef Cvačka, Ph.D., for providing the testing data. Mgr. Martin Hubálek, Ph.D., has my sincerest thanks for relentlessly answering my many questions related to mass spectrometry.

  My dear Lucka deserves special gratitude for enduring the many unsolicited mini-lectures about fragmentation in mass spectrometry, and for always being there for me when I needed it.

  Last but not least, I am grateful to my parents for their perpetual support throughout my studies at the university, and for the many compromises they had to make in order for me to successfully finish writing this thesis.

\def\AbstractEN{%
  Disulphide bonds are crucial to correct protein folding, and heavily influence protein function. Tandem mass spectrometry protein analysis is often used for the determination of disulphide bond positions. In this thesis we devise a program for automatic disulphide bond characterization called Dibby. Dibby identifies fragments from the fragmentation spectra, and uses them to determine which cysteines were connected in the original protein. The identification algorithm is able to identify even complex fragments with multiple disulphide bonds that are often missed by other methods. To reduce the fragment search space, we employ divide and conquer and branch and bound techniques. We evaluate Dibby on both measured and in-silico generated datasets, and find that it correctly identifies large portion of the disulphide bonds with minimal manual interventions.
